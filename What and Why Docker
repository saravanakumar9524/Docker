What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers.

A container includes everything needed to run an application—code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and dependencies—ensuring consistency across environments.

Key Concepts:
Containers: These are like mini-virtual machines, but they share the same operating system, which makes them more efficient.
Docker Engine: This is the software that runs on your computer or server and manages the containers.
Portability: Since containers include everything the app needs, they can run on any machine with Docker installed, whether it’s your laptop or a server in the cloud.


Why do we need docker?

Ensures "build once, run anywhere" for consistent behavior across development, testing, and production.

Provides an isolated environment to eliminate dependency issues and run applications seamlessly on any system.

Accelerates CI/CD pipelines, simplifying the building, testing, and deployment process.

Docker containers use fewer resources than traditional virtual machines, making them faster and easier to scale.
